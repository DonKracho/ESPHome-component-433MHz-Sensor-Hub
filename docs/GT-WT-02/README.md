# The GT-WT-02 sensor

![GT-WT-02 sensor](gt-wt-02.jpg)

The GlobalTronic GT-WT-02 Sensor uses a 37 bit protocol with checksum. This temperature/humidity 433Mhz sensor is well build, but may be not available anymore.
I used some of them for years until I got a bunch of very cheap Digoo sensors for replacements.
